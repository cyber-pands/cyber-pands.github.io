    <p>
      I am a cybersecurity professional who believes real understanding comes from
      building systems, observing how they fail, and documenting what those failures
      teach us. I enjoy working close to the data, asking why something happened,
      and turning that understanding into practical security improvements.

  <!-- APPROACH -->
  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>How I Approach Cybersecurity</h2>

    <p>
      I do not see cybersecurity as a checklist of tools or certifications.
      My approach is rooted in understanding context. I care more about why an event
      occurred than simply acknowledging that an alert was raised.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether I am looking at authentication logs, web traffic, or suspicious system
      activity, I prefer to break problems down step by step. I start from raw data,
      examine patterns and behavior, and work toward conclusions that actually make
      sense in a real environment.

    <h2>Hands-on Practice</h2>

    <p class="muted">
      I regularly reinforce my skills through hands on labs and practical challenges
      that simulate real world security scenarios rather than isolated theory.

  <!-- LEARNING -->
  <section class="about-section highlight">
    <h2>How I Learn & Improve</h2>

    <p>
      I learn best by doing and by documenting what I discover along the way.
      Writing forces clarity, especially when things do not work as expected.
      I treat mistakes and failed assumptions as part of the learning process.
    </p>

    <p>
      I focus on depth rather than surface level exposure and regularly revisit
      fundamentals to strengthen my understanding as I grow.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CURRENT FOCUS -->
  <section class="about-section end">
    <h2>Current Focus</h2>

    <p>
      At the moment, I am focused on improving detection skills, strengthening
      security tooling, and developing a deeper understanding of how real world
      attacks behave across different environments.
